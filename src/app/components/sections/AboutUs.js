            In 2010, African Sun Productions finally launched its own
            enterprise. After filming and editing freelance for 7 years,
            covering 11 countries and 3 continents, ASP was ready to serve the
            discerning hunter directly.

          <br />
          <p>
            We have since filmed in 17 countries on 4 continents. We have proven
            that We Get The Shot, no matter the circumstances.
          </p>
          <br />

            ASP is owner-run. Martin MÃ¼ller does most of the filming and
            editing, and we have freelance cameramen available, all pre-screened
            to ensure they will fit in with hunters and deliver the quality that
            is needed and expected from an African Sun Productions cameraman.
