          <h2>What You Pay</h2>
          <p>
            $390 per day. Included in this is the filming and editing of your
            movie in full HD, postage of your final product to your house and,
            if needed, a voice over to round of your movie. It's the same price
            for either Dangerous Game or Plains Game, in South Africa or abroad.
            You need to book a minimum of 5 hunting days. The client is
            responsible for any travel and accommodation costs for the duration
            of the hunt, so be sure to ask your outfitter if any observer fees
            are payable. I do not charge a daily rate for the travelling days on
            either side of the hunt, only the actual travel cost.
          </p>

          <h2>What You Get</h2>
          <p>
            You will receive a fully edited copy of your movie on USB drive,
            digital download and/streaming platform. You will also receive a
            photobook with a selection of photos from your hunt. I take photos
            not only of the trophies, but also in camp, while travelling,
            landscapes etc. Photos are all provided at full resolution. Short
            clips of each trophy can be uploaded to Youtube. If you prefer not
            to upload any videos, it’s no problem. I travel with 2 main cameras,
            so I always have a backup if one fails. I use multiple GoPro
            cameras, and also travel with a 4K capable drone for aerial photos
            and video. Some countries don’t allow drones, so availability is not
            guaranteed if hunting outside of South Africa.

          <h2>Check Us Out</h2>
          <p>
            Please have a look on Youtube and Facebook, you will find some of
            our work there. You will notice that we don’t do re-enactments. We
            film the actual stalking and shots as it happens. Nothing replaces
            the excitement of the actual event.
